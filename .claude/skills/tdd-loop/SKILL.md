description: Use when implementing any feature, bug fix, or refactor in the build/ pipeline. Enforces test-first discipline as a tight red→green→refactor cycle. Mandatory for the implementer agent (per testing-discipline rule).

# TDD Loop

The unit of TDD work is a single behavior, not a single function. One behavior = one cycle = ideally one commit.

## The cycle

1. **Red.** Write the smallest test that captures the next unimplemented behavior. Name the test for the behavior, not the implementation: `test_user_can_log_in_with_valid_credentials`, not `test_login_function`.
2. **Run the test. Confirm it fails for the right reason.** A test that fails because of a syntax error elsewhere is not a red. The failure must be the *assertion* failing or the *function being missing*.
3. **Green.** Write the minimum code that makes the test pass. Resist the urge to anticipate the next test. The next test will tell you what's needed.
4. **Run all tests. Confirm everything passes.**
5. **Refactor.** With the safety net of passing tests, clean up: extract names, remove duplication, tighten signatures. Do NOT change behavior. Re-run tests after each substantive edit.
6. **Commit.** One commit captures the red+green+refactor for one behavior.

## Per-stage discipline

- **Red:** if the test passes immediately, the test is wrong (testing the wrong thing or already-existing behavior). Stop and fix the test.
- **Green:** if making the test pass requires touching files outside the obvious scope, the spec or design is wrong. Stop and revisit.
- **Refactor:** if a refactor breaks a different test, the refactor changed behavior. Revert the refactor; either keep the duplication or update the test (separately).

## What you're testing

Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — `test_user_can_log_in_with_valid_credentials` tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure. The warning sign of an implementation-coupled test: it breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.

## Vertical vs horizontal slicing

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** That is "horizontal slicing" — treating Red as "write all tests" and Green as "write all code." It produces crap tests: they verify imagined behavior, lock you into the shape of things before you understand the implementation, and pass when behavior breaks because they were written without seeing what mattered.

Correct shape is **vertical slices via tracer bullets**: one test → one implementation → next test responds to what you just learned.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## When to break the cycle

- **Spike work** (lab/): TDD often unhelpful for throwaway prototypes. Use the spike-protocol skill instead.
- **Pure data migrations / config changes**: write the validation step (an assertion that the migration produced the expected state), not a unit test.
- **External-system integration**: write a contract test against a fake first; integration test against the real system later, separately.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing five tests then five implementations. The cycle is one-and-one.
- Mocking the layer under test. Mock external boundaries; real-implement what you're verifying.
- "Add tests later" — no. The pre-commit-tdd.sh hook enforces test files in the same diff as code files.
- Commenting out a failing test to "fix later." Delete it or fix it; do not leave it as silent debt.
