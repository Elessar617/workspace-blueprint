# Third-Party Licenses

Skills under this directory marked with `vendored_from:` in their frontmatter were copied from external Claude Code plugins. Per the upstream MIT license terms, copyright and permission notices are preserved below for each upstream source.

Vendored content is refreshed with `npm run refresh-vendored`. Each vendored file's `vendored_from:` frontmatter records the upstream plugin name and version it was copied from; the refresh script also keeps the `Version vendored` lines below in sync for existing upstream sections. Last refresh: 2026-05-12.
